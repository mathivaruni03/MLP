# MLP
MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) is a feedforward neural network with input, hidden, and output layers. Each neuron applies an activation function, and training uses backpropagation. Feedforward MLP moves data in one direction, from input to output, making it effective for classification and regression tasks. ðŸš€
